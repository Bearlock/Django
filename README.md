# Django
The usual Django side project of setting up a blog. 
<br />
<br />
This served as my first introduction to Django. I completed the initial polls app that Django provides in its tutorials. From there I moved on to seeing what I could create on my own. Django is very accessible and was easy to utilize as a CMS of sorts. A project that most people seem to do is create their own blogging platform.

I decided to travel the road many others had before, and create my own blog app. It isn't anywhere near perfect, but I was able to write a few good posts and keep track of them using this. It isn't something I am currently working on, but I like it as a proof of concept that I can actually accomplish something. I would like to revisit this down the road and tweak what needs to be tweaked.
